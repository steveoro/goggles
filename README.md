## Goggles  -o^o-
### Swimming Results Browser & "Swimming Life-style" enhancer

Goggles is a Rails application developed to manage the storage of the results from any official
Swimming competition as well as a lot more of anything else related to the "Master Swimming"
way of life, implementing also basic social features for sharing swimming-pools and sporting venues
reviews, informations, trainings, unofficial recorded data, lesson & training presence and a
lot more.

Goggles has a complex data-import sub-process able to parse results and starting-list files
generated from several sources all over the net. This allows recurrent jobs to automatically update
the underlying database with all the official and supported data sources.

The official site is still in closed beta and reserved for a few selected Swimming Teams. 
The admin/data-import sub-app will be extracted and refactored from the main front-end app as
soon as the site will be ready for open beta.
