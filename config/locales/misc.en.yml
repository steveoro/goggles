    how_to_claculate_training_paces_1: "After a quick warm-up, swim for 2000 meters in free style, at a well-substained & steady pace, without stopping. Try to make it through the end as quickly as possible and write down the overall timing it took you."

    record_del_mondo_in_allenamento: "Wow! ...A world record during a workout! Get some rest now, we'll talk about training paces later! :-)"
    train_explanation_title: "That's nice, but... Now, how do I use the training paces that I've got?"
    train_explanation_1: "That's an easy one! The training pace is the target timing that you need to aim for at the end of each lap in your workout. To this result timing, you need to add the rest pause (depending upon the type of workout) to obtain the actual overall lap time needed for the workout during each subsequent repeated lap ('Start-Rest' overall time)."
    train_explanation_2: "So, for instance, if your B1 on 100 m. is {B1_100}, an hypothethical B1 workout core could be:"
    train_explanation_3: "16x100 FS S-R {B1_100_SR}"
    train_explanation_4: " (where each 100 must be swam not slower than {B1_100} while restarting the subsequent lap at {B1_100_SR})"
    train_explanation_5: "Keep this result and repeat this test periodically to see if your workout is working, in order to keep up with your actual physical state."
    coach_is_better_1: "Also, keep in mind that currently there's no Software better than a good Coach. If you have one, trust him. ;-)"
    coach_is_better_2: "But if you're a thirsty water rhabdomantist seeker, condamned be adverse logistics to a lonely life at the pools, then we surely hope to give you some help with this table, that gives you the needed paces for different aerobic workouts."
    train_disclaimer_1: "This table is computed using a 'medium-trained' subject as parameter."
    train_disclaimer_2: "Be sure to be in good health and have a periodic medical check-up before jumping into intense workout sessions."
