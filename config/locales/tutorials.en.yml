    how_to_register_text:
      line1: "Are You a Master Swimmer? (Duh!)"
      line2: "...And maybe You'd like to see reconstructed your swimming career of the last twelve years. You know... Even for those times where you were swimming in cloth briefs and you didn't event think about keeping record of what you did."
      line3: "Or, maybe, You'd love to peek a proud look at your virtual medal count without loosing an afternoon to untangle your medal cords, all stuffed inside a lost box somewhere in your library?"
      line4: "Or, even yet and why not, You'd love to compare your performances and your achievements, checking the lap passage times collected at the meetings, although they are all fading to yellow on an ancient piece of paper on the bottom of the third drawer of some furniture in your living room?"
      line5: "Can You relate to all this? Well, then surely Goggles can help. While you're reading this stuff, Goggles is slowly but unrelentingly acquiring data from various Master's Meetings, to eventually be able to show them all cleaned, ordered and grouped together. Probably, even now Goggles knows some of Your results and it could show them to you in chronological order or by performance achievements, presenting you with statistical data, rankings and medals."
      line6: "In order for Goggles to do so, You just need to register and create your profile. Click on 'Sign-up!' on the welcome page. We'll ask You just enough data to match Your profile with an existing swimmer (surname, name, date of birth) and an e-mail address to authenticate yourself and - only if You whish - to receive notifies and updates on your results and your team mates'"
      line7: "Once You've registered, You'll be able to associate Yourself to a matching Swimmer and visit your 'ID-Card' page (your 'Radiography')... And then the fun begins!"
      line8: "Goggles is totally free and we promise we never give access to Your personal data to others. We guarantee that we won't ever contact You for commercial purposes. If You're interested and want to know more, just give a read to Goggles' history"
      line9: "You can cancel Your registration in any moment and go back to keeping results on paper and spreadsheets, anytime. ;-P"

      line10: "Follow these easy steps: (really, promise: no one's gonna try to sell you a cookware set!)"
      line11: "Go to Registration/Sign-up page"
      line12: "Compile Your profile"
      line13: "Don't give up easily, and click also on the link to the Swimmer association (because you're an athlete, right?)"
      line14: "Follow Goggles lead to match you with a swimmer, or chose one manually (contact us if your name isn't in the list!)"

    what_can_i_do_text:
      line0: "A short overview"
      line1: "With Goggles You can browse the results of the Master Swimming Championships currently active (FIN, FINA, LEN, CSI, ...). If a Championship Circuit is missing, You can bet that sooner or later we'll figure out a way to add it to the list of supported data results."
      line2: "Inside the results pages You'll find, highlighted, your own results, your friends' and team mates'."
      line3: "Besides the overall heat results, you'll get dedicated sections for one of the attending Teams and Swimmers."
      line4: "And, more over, beyond a mandatory Team ranking list, you'll get a handful of dedicated stats (both for swimmers and teams)."
      line5: "Goggles can also store and show You the lap times (the 'passages') painstakingly hand-recorded in between each pool turn by your burly team manager or by your beloving team mates."
      line6: "You just have to send them to us in the format you prefer; after being inserted into the system, they'll appear as clickable links inside the result pages and will yield precious information for the page dedicated to your own performace."
      line7: "Goggles has a dedicated Radiography page for each swimmer. Or, that is, 'Your history according to the Chronometer'."
      line8: "It's a bunch of dedicated views and reports in which you'll (re-)discover Your own result history, both in chronological order (the 'career') or by swimming style and timing (the 'performances')."
      line9: "In a dedicated section You'll find the obligatory report about your best timings and records, divided and ordered by pool type (length) and swimming style, while, in another, You'll get your medal list, grouped by federation type and specialty."
      line10: "But swimming is not just about individuals. Goggles would love to help you create a good team-mood. Thus, You'll find dedicated sections for your Team as well as for any of the Teams we have data acquired for."
      line11: "Beyond the overall medals and the list of currently associated swimmers, here You'll find the Team records, divided as usual by pool type and swimming style."
      line12: "That is not all. Goggles can manage for you a 'Goggle Cup', a special internal Championship based upon each Team special achievements and records, to keep an eye upon your team mates and stimulate internal competition, just to give a little more spice to each Season."
      line13: "Do you wanna know how many FIN table scores will yield You any given competition while you're still feeling it in your arms?"
      line14: "Goggles gives You the FIN table score calculator, using the currently defined base scoring tables of the Federation, updated for all swimming categories and specialties, while showing You your best seasonal timings and team records, just for that extra feedback you're always seeking."
      line15: "And, least but not last, Goggles knows that Swimming is also science, method, commitment, beside (obviously) talent. But also, and why not, lenghty dinners spent with friends organizing trips and parties about the end of each Meeting."
      line16: "While on the dinner and party stuff we are all obviously very skilled at (and we apply with great dedication), the tech, training & science stuff is not so obvious. It's always hard to keep track of your own trainings while trying to maintain a global vision of its goals."
      line17: "This is why Goggles gives You also the possibility to store Your own trainings, and to review them any time you want, to analyze the volume, the composition and the overall quality."
