    disclaimer_title: "A bunch of friendly disclaimers to keep on your mind..."
    disclaimer_1: "Remember to check out periodically the official web sites of the Federations or the meetings in which you are interested, just to know the actual and current Meeting dates and to get informed about any possible last minute changes."
    disclaimer_2: "We cannot guarantee (yet) a real-time update for both the dates and the actual places of all the registered Meetings. In other words: don't blame us if you ever miss a Meeting just because you thought it would be at a certain date, while the official web site published the re-scheduling and we didn't. It's your responsability to be correctly informed."
    disclaimer_3: "The data and the instruments that we give to our users are to be considered for 'personal use', with no claims of 'officiality', because although the data is acquired from the official results published by each federation, they could still contain mistakes. If something seems plainly wrong or 'it does not compute' for you, just tell us and we'll try to fix it as soon as we can."

      title: "Overview"
      subtitle: "How does this work?"
      part1: "With Goggles You can browse the results from the Master Swimming Championships currently active among several federations (FIN, FINA, LEN, CSI, ...). If a Championship Circuit or Federation is missing, You can bet that sooner or later we'll figure out a way to add it to the list of supported data results."
      part2: "Goggles is totally free and is born from the passionate work of Master swimmers like you. We wanted a tool that showcased and archived thoroughly our results as no one had done before. So we put a lot of effort in it."
      part3: "Goggles acquires, in a more or less automatic way, the Meetings results published on-line by the federations, but accepts also those supplied (by hand :-)) directly by volunteers, sometimes only available in paper format. (We obviously need volunteers to do this: if you have results and you want to publish them, please contact us via e-mail.)"
      part4: "The data is then linked together during acquisition and, when there's enough of it available, it allows Goggles to produce detailed statistics and performance reports over time for each one of the athletes participating in the competitions. We call this view the 'Radiography' of the swimmer. It is available for all the swimmers who have at least some published results, not only for users. (But being a user allows to show more details.)"
      part5: "In this way you can compare your current performances with the past or rediscover old results or forgotten personal records."
      part6: "In order to state your identity to Goggles, when creating a user, you have the option to associate your account with a swimmer (if there are already any meeting results concerning him), thus allowing Goggles to showcase the data in more customized view, according to your team and the races that you made."
      part7: "And, if you're also the coordinator of your swimming team, after registering your account, you can also ask us by e-mail to enable your account as a 'Team manager', so that you can then enter directly from the site the passage/lap times of yours and your friends or teammates."
      part8: "As a 'team' manager, you can also access the interface to manage a convenient list of those who will participate or not to a specific meeting among all the members of the team. This allows you to eventually get a printable report, sorted by the events of the chosen Meeting, on which you'll be able to write down more easily all the passages or lap times of each race or event."
      part9: "Goggles, among other things, allows the creation and the management of various training models, customizable, printable and sharable (in case you want it - but you can also decide to keep them secret and accessible only to you, just in case). Just keep in mind that the training management feature is still in 'beta' and it will be subject to strong restyling in the future. (But no training among those already entered will be deleted or edited.)"

      gogglecup_intro2: "In this example, CSI Swimming Ober Ferrari team has told us to define a Goggle-Cup, called 'Ober Cup', which, briefly, establishes an internal ranking for all swimmers in the team in the current academic year, considering just the best 5 results achieved. Scores are assigned by the FIN Regulation (thus, in milliseconds) and compared to previous results. The idea is to promote performance self-improvement. At the end of the academic year they make a dinner together where they award the final results."
      gogglecup_1: "The Goggle-Cup sub-page of the current swimmer, in this case, shows all the events taken into account for the calculation of the final score (where those ticked in green are the best 5 results), together with the base reference timing for each event."

Clicking on the name of the pool, on the other hand, brings you to the pool's details page."
      current_2: "If your user is also enabled as a 'team manager', the 'reservations sheet' button will appear when consulting any meeting list. This allows you to reach the 'reservations management' subpage for the chosen meeting. The 'reservations sheet' will serve as a printable list of those who will participate in the races for all the managed teams, in order to write down more easily the lap times for each race event."
      results: "The results page of a meeting allows you to click on each athlete name in order to show the subpage regarding his or hers individual results (for the current meeting). This works too for the Team's name, bringing you to the overall results subpage for that team."

      line_2: "The 'reservation sheet' thus created, currently, it's only used to obtain a printable PDF note, on which you can write down more comfortably the lap times during each event race. The actual registrations, of course, have still to be made through the usual federation channels by the team manager."
      line_3: "Nonetheless, we have found that having a tool just to keep track in a single place of anywho among the team members confirms or denies attending the meeting, simplifies a lot the life of the team manager. Not to mention having a convenient pre-filled paper on which write down each event lap timings..."
      line_4: "The reservation sheet is created with all the athletes enrolled in the teams that you are supervising. The 'team manager' can modify all the athletes fields and rows.

      fin_score_2: "Pressing on the final 'Compute' button, Goggles returns the possible FIN score, based upon current Championship's record timings for the chosen event specialty."
      fin_time_subtitle: "FIN goal timing calculation"
      fin_time_1: "As before, if you are logged in with your user, many of the fields appear as  pre-selected. To calculate the goal time you have to select all the parameters by pressing on each line with a button and entering the score that you would like to achieve."
      fin_time_2: "Pressing the calculation button, Goggles returns the target time it takes to achieve the desired FIN score (for the current championship), for the selected event specialty and category type."

      duel_2: "This can be a 'bloodless way' to check the progress of those you usually find yourself with in the same heat during call time. But, maybe, it can also be a way to bet a few beers (or whatever you want) ..."

      review_subtitle: "Pool reviews (or comments)"
      review_edit: "By clicking on the button to add a new comment in the 'reviews' tab (which only appears when you are logged in with your username), you reach a fillable form where you can enter what you remember of that pool or any comments you may whish to say about it. Just don't be a troll and try to be useful: if you see too many pools as we do, one late day you may whish you wrote down somewhere that you had to carry an extra lock for the locker room, a rubber mat or whatever. You get the point."
      review_show: "When you access the details of a pool review, the comment is displayed in full, together with a couple of evaluation keys (positive or negative) about the comment. Clicking on the arrow up you upvote the comment as useful; clicking on the down arrow you downvote the comment as useless or harmful."

    trainings:
      social_subtitle: "Trainings and sharing"
      intro: "Under 'Misc', in the side menu, you can access the management section for workouts and training models. Each user training can be created from scratch or based on a copy of a pre-existing training or from a model, which will be used as a starting base."
      intro2: "Each workout or user training model is tied to the user who created it, although it is possible to share it with someone who has been declared as a 'swimming buddy' (a training partner or a team member)."
      social1: "Normally, Goggles defines as 'training partners' ('Swimming buddy') all members of the same team automatically, but you can either remove, block or require (ask) the friendship of any other athlete that is a 'Goggler', that is, who has also a user in the system. (The sharing of any training is possible only between registered users.)"
      social2: "To edit the list of your training partners, just select from the side menu 'Swimming buddies'. From the list of users that appears, by clicking on a name you reach the corresponding swimmer Radiography, where you'll find the sharing option buttons."
      social3: "The button to confirm/unconfirm the swimmer identity, is used to declare that you know personally that swimmer and that you think that the association between that swimmer and his or her user name is real. (Obviously, you can also de-confirm a user, if you think you've made a mistake or if you're not sure of his/her digital identity.) Currently, a confirmed user ('Goggler') can actually do little more than one 'normal', unconfirmed user - but, alas, he still gets our respect. :-)"
      social4: "On the Radiography of a 'Goggler' swimmer, by clicking on 'Edit', you can edit the parameters of the friendship share (or of the friend request)."
      social4_1: "Creating and sharing custom race calendars has been currently only planned but not yet introduced."
      social5: "By clicking on 'Remove' you eliminate completely the possibility of sharing - or the request (if this has not yet been accepted)."

      search2: "By clicking on 'PDF' you get the training printable file. By clicking on 'Copy' you will create a new workout using this one as the basis for the new one."
      search3: "By clicking on 'I did this' you add a 'training story', which simply tells Goggles that you have performed that workout, together with a comment on your performance or on the training itself. In this way, you can create a journal of the workouts performed, but also you give Goggles the ability to keep track of your total meters swam and of how much you have been exercising during a sporting year."
      edit: "Clicking on the button for adding a new training (or editing an existing one, if the current user owns it) leads you to the very complex training creation / modification form."
      edit2: "This view allows you to create several custom rows of training by editing each individual parameters of each single row, and it allows you to reorder, or to group them by simply drag'n'drop a whole row."
      edit3: "The interface in its present form (which in any case is still temporary) is so complex that it discourages the less adventurous. But fear not: we are working on a couple of alternatives that we will show you in the future, as soon as possible."
      show: "Clicking on the name of a listed workout shows the details, with the relative buttons to download a printable copy, or to copy it as a new training of yours (whether it is a shared training or not), in order to change the contents."
      show1: "If you own a training, of course, you also get displayed a button to edit it."
      stories_subtitle: "Training 'stories'"
      stories: "A 'training story' is simply a record row that says that your user has performed that workout on a certain day, along with a possible comment."
      stories2: "Goggles assumes that the total swim distance is the one for each stored workout. For this reason, if you are planning to redo the same training on more days and, maybe, just varying the distance on some day or another, you should create a unique training model to be copied onto multiple user trainings, or at least have more unique copies of the same workout, in order for each to indicate the actual distance swam."
      radio_show: "When created, the training sessions held are briefly summarized in the dedicated sub-page of the Radiography of a swimmer."

    how_to_register_text:
      line1: "Are You a Master Swimmer? (Duh!)"
      line2: "...And maybe You'd like to see reconstructed your swimming career of the last twelve years. You know... Even for those times where you were swimming in cloth briefs and you didn't event think about keeping record of what you did."
      line3: "Or, maybe, You'd love to peek a proud look at your virtual medal count without loosing an afternoon to untangle your medal cords, all stuffed inside a lost box somewhere in your library?"
      line4: "Or, even yet and why not, You'd love to compare your performances and your achievements, checking the lap passage times collected at the meetings, although they are all fading to yellow on an ancient piece of paper on the bottom of the third drawer of some furniture in your living room?"
      line5: "Can You relate to all this? Well, then surely Goggles can help. While you're reading this stuff, Goggles is slowly but unrelentingly acquiring data from various Master's Meetings, to eventually be able to show them all cleaned, ordered and grouped together. Probably, even now Goggles knows some of Your results and it could show them to you in chronological order or by performance achievements, presenting you with statistical data, rankings and medals."
      line6: "In order for Goggles to do so, You just need to register and create your profile. Click on 'Sign-up!' on the welcome page. We'll ask You just enough data to match Your profile with an existing swimmer (surname, name, date of birth) and an e-mail address to authenticate yourself and - only if You whish - to receive notifies and updates on your results and your team mates'"
      line7: "Once You've registered, You'll be able to associate Yourself to a matching Swimmer and visit your 'ID-Card' page (your 'Radiography')... And then the fun begins!"

      regi_steps_title: "The registration procedure"
      line8: "Goggles is totally free and we promise we'll never give access to Your personal data to others. We guarantee that we won't ever contact You for commercial purposes. If You're interested and want to know more, just give a read about Goggles' history in the 'Overview' section."
      line9: "You can cancel Your registration in any moment and go back to keeping results on paper and spreadsheets, anytime. ;-P"

      line3: "Besides the overall heat results, you'll get dedicated sections for one of the attending Teams and Swimmers."
      line4: "And, more over, beyond a mandatory Team ranking list, you'll get a handful of dedicated stats (both for swimmers and teams)."
      line5: "Goggles can also store and show You the lap times (the 'passages') painstakingly hand-recorded in between each pool turn by your burly team manager or by your beloving team mates."
      line6: "You just have to send them to us in the format you prefer; after being inserted into the system, they'll appear as clickable links inside the result pages and will yield precious information for the page dedicated to your own performace."
      line7: "Goggles has a dedicated Radiography page for each swimmer. Or, that is, 'Your history according to the Chronometer'."
      line8: "It's a bunch of dedicated views and reports in which you'll (re-)discover Your own result history, both in chronological order (the 'career') or by swimming style and timing (the 'performances')."
      line9: "In a dedicated section You'll find the obligatory report about your best timings and records, divided and ordered by pool type (length) and swimming style, while, in another, You'll get your medal list, grouped by federation type and specialty."
      line10: "But swimming is not just about individuals. Goggles would love to help you create a good team-mood. Thus, You'll find dedicated sections for your Team as well as for any of the Teams we have data acquired for."
      line11: "Beyond the overall medals and the list of currently associated swimmers, here You'll find the Team records, divided as usual by pool type and swimming style."
      line12: "That is not all. Goggles can manage for you a 'Goggle Cup', a special internal Championship based upon each Team special achievements and records, to keep an eye upon your team mates and stimulate internal competition, just to give a little more spice to each Season."
      line13: "Do you wanna know how many FIN table scores will yield You any given competition while you're still feeling it in your arms?"
      line14: "Goggles gives You the FIN table score calculator, using the currently defined base scoring tables of the Federation, updated for all swimming categories and specialties, while showing You your best seasonal timings and team records, just for that extra feedback you're always seeking."
      line15: "And, least but not last, Goggles knows that Swimming is also science, method, commitment, beside (obviously) talent. But also, and why not, lenghty dinners spent with friends organizing trips and parties about the end of each Meeting."
      line16: "While on the dinner and party stuff we are all obviously very skilled at (and we apply with great dedication), the tech, training & science stuff is not so obvious. It's always hard to keep track of your own trainings while trying to maintain a global vision of its goals."
      line17: "This is why Goggles gives You also the possibility to store Your own trainings, and to review them any time you want, to analyze the volume, the composition and the overall quality."
