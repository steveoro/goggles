      title: "So, what this 'Goggles' is about?!?"
      part_1: "Goggles is a site (duh!), completely free for all levels of Master swimmers. Open to all and free for all. From the most hard-workers, capable of training even more than once a day, to the ones who seldom take a bath in a Swimming Pool."
      part_2: "Swimming translates to Body, Passion but also Science. Training is fun, hard-work, sweat, dedication, but also quality and method. Swimming Meetings are a challenge, a goal to be reached, a limit to overcome, but also team mates and friends."
      part_3: "Goggles would like to be the place where you can browse all you swimming results, keep track of your history and check-out the lap passage data, store and analyze the trainings, find useful info on the Swimming Pools and Meetings and, perhaps, organize your group training or a quick swimming session while you're travelling around."
      part_4: "Goggles would love to share with everyone the Swimming Passion, while offering analysis tools, sharing everyone's experience and giving away some hints to improve your Swimming life."

      title: "Be patient! :-)"
      part_1: "Goggles is just moving its first strokes!"
      part_2: "At the beginning it may result a little clumsy and goofy and it will surely yield some errors, but it will surely fly! Because it has already spent several years settling in, using the didactic swimming-pool of its creators..."
      part_3: "Give us your opinion: tell us what you don't like and what it should be added, to help us reach our goal sooner and become even more effective!"
