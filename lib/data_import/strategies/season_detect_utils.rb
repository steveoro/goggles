  - Goggles framework vers.:  4.00.735
  - author: Steve A.

  Data-Import/Digest Module incapsulating all season detector utility methods,
  shared by the DataImporter class (for FIN-type datafiles) & by the CsiResultParser class.

  Extracted from the original DataImporter implementation.

  == Defines:
  @season: a valid instance of Season. Returned and defined after calling any of
           the included methods.

  # Tries to detect/parse the season of the data files by looking at the container
  # path of the files.
  #
  # This method updates directly the internal #season member but it does nothing
  # if it has already a value.
  #
  # === Example:
  #
  #     "uploads"  [ / ] "results.132"  [ / ]  "ris20121123test.txt"
  #
  # => This will force Season with ID #132 for all the files contained therein.
  #
  #
  # === Returns
  # A Season instance when successfull or +nil+ when unable to parse the pathname.
  #

  # A Season instance when successfull or +nil+ when unable to parse the pathname.
