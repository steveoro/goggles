  # Edits the matrix of reservations for the selected meeting, for the whole team
  # of the currently logged-in user.
  #
  # If the user is a team manager, the whole matrix of rows is editable.
  #
  # If no reservation rows are found, a new (empty but serialized on DB) matrix
  # of events reservations is created, having a single MeetingReservationRow for
  # each possibile event of the chosen meeting, for each and every one if the swimmers
  # currently registered to the current user's team affiliation.

  # *only* if no rows are found.
